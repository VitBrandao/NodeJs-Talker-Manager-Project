### Talker Manager Project

This project was my **first experience** with NodeJs.

Where can you can find my codes?
- The **middlewares** directory contains all the functions that receive **(req, res** and **next**) as parameters;
- Inside the same directory you will find another directory called **validations** which contains some functions whose logic could be used in more than one part of the code.
- The **index.js** file in the root contains all the requests (**GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**), the **Express module import** and the **Express.listen()** to set the 3000 localhost port as the server.
